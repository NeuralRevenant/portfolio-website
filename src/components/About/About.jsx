              Hello! My name is <strong>Kaushik Chaturvedula</strong>. I'm a
              passionate Software Engineer with strong experience building
              high-performance, scalable software systems across microservices,
              LLM-based agents, and full-stack architectures.

              I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science
              from
              <strong> Purdue University Fort Wayne</strong> with a perfect GPA
              of 4.0/4.0. I completed the 30-credit-hour program in just three
              semesters, ranking among the top in several advanced courses. My
              curriculum focused on AI, Machine Learning, full-stack
              engineering, and scalable systems, combining rigorous theory with
              extensive hands-on development.

              My graduate coursework included: Natural Language Processing,
              Machine Learning, Computer Vision, High-Performance Computing,
              Full-Stack Development, Operating Systems, HCI, Game Design,
              Algorithm Design, and Software Engineering. I also served as a
              Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant for Programming Language
              Design, mentoring students and contributing to large-scale
              computational research.

              <strong>Wibmo</strong> as an Associate Software Engineer, where I
              developed fraud detection systems and event-driven microservices.
              I've also held multiple internships contributing to microservice
              optimization, database systems, and web platforms.
