                At Medical Informatics Engineering, I designed and developed a
                powerful Agentic Medical Chatbot and a Semantic Query Engine for
                electronic health records (EHR), leveraging Agentic
                Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG), advanced NLP, and
                LLM-based plannerâ€“executor (ReAct) architectures. I also
                explored the traditional RAG with NER and intent classification
                with GPT-4o-driven semantic parsing and multi-hop reasoning. I
                implemented dynamic query planning, OpenSearch-based hybrid
                semantic search, and optimized memory-augmented retrieval to
                enable real-time, context-aware responses to complex medical
                queries. I also designed and deployed scalable frontend
                (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) services, integrating them
                seamlessly into secure, cloud-native infrastructures using
                OpenAI-compatible proxy layers and transformer-based embedding
                models.

                closely with professors to deliver course material, grade
                assignments, and provide academic support, ensuring students
                grasp complex programming concepts. In my Research Assistant
                role, I contribute to the <em>CosmoSim</em> project on
                high-performance computational cosmological simulations.
                Handling datasets exceeding 300TB, I implement advanced parallel
                processing techniques in Python to enhance performance in
                high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

                At Wibmo, I developed and optimized backend services for a

                prevention measures, such as identifying potential money
                laundering and BIN attacks. By designing and implementing a
                microservices architecture, I improved scalability and system
                reliability under high-traffic conditions. Additionally, I
                reduced latency by 20% by developing asynchronous, event-driven
                systems with RabbitMQ and Kafka, and optimized transaction
                processing time using advanced techniques. My work also
                encompassed contributing to data migration scripts and a diverse
                tech stack, including Spring Boot, MySQL, Couchbase, Redis,
                Node.js, Docker, Linux, and AWS, to deliver robust and secure
